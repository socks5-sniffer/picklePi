## 📖 About

**picklePi** is a structured, gamified, project-based learning platform designed to teach electronics and Python programming using the Raspberry Pi. Learners progress from their very first LED blink all the way to building a complete physical tamper-monitoring security system — across 13 carefully sequenced levels.

No prior experience needed. If you can plug in a USB cable and type on a keyboard, you're already qualified. 🎉

Every project on picklePi is more than just code. Each one is a full guided lesson:

- 📋 **Detailed hardware setup** — step-by-step wiring instructions with safety warnings
- 💻 **Complete, runnable Python code** — ready to copy and run on your Pi
- 📚 **Code walkthroughs** — every line explained in plain English
- 🔬 **Concept deep dives** — the physics, hardware, and software behind what you built
- 🧪 **Experiment challenges** — tweak, extend, and break things on purpose
- 🔧 **Troubleshooting guides** — common failures and how to fix them

Progress is tracked locally in your browser. Completing a project earns a badge and unlocks the next challenge.

## 🎯 Who Is This For?

picklePi is designed for **kids, teens, and curious people of all ages** who want to learn how electronics and programming work together — using real hardware they can hold in their hands.

| If you are… | picklePi can help you… |
|-------------|------------------------|
| 🧒 A beginner (age 10+) with no coding experience | Start from zero and build real things that blink and beep |
| 🎓 A student looking for a STEM project | Work through a full curriculum at your own pace |
| 👩‍🏫 A teacher or parent | Use it as a structured, self-guided learning companion |
| 🧑‍💻 A tinkerer who learns by doing | Skip ahead and dive into the projects that interest you |

> **Note for younger learners:** Some steps involve small electronic components and wires. It's always a good idea to have a grown-up nearby, especially when you're getting started. A few basics to keep in mind: handle components by their edges (not the metal pins), keep electronics away from water, don't force connections, and never connect components to power without double-checking your wiring first. Safety first — then blink the LED! 💡

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18 or newer
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- A Raspberry Pi with Python 3 and `gpiozero` installed (for running the code examples)

> 🖥️ **Just want to explore the app?** You only need Node.js and Git — no Raspberry Pi required to browse projects, read the curriculum, or check out the GPIO pinout reference. You just won't be able to run the Python code until you have a Pi handy.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/socks5-sniffer/picklePi.git
   cd picklePi
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The server starts on `https://localhost:3000` (HTTPS is enabled automatically via `mkcert`). On first run, `mkcert` will generate a local certificate; your browser may ask you to trust it.

4. **Open in browser**

   Navigate to `https://localhost:3000`

### Available Scripts

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start HTTPS dev server on port 3000 (accessible on your local network) |
| `npm run build` | Compile TypeScript and create an optimized production build in `dist/` |
| `npm run preview` | Serve the production build locally for testing |
| `npm run lint` | Run TypeScript type checking (`tsc --noEmit`) |
| `npm run clean` | Delete the `dist/` build output directory |

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

The production build is output to the `dist/` directory. It is a fully static site that can be served by any static file host (Netlify, GitHub Pages, Vercel, etc.).

## 🐍 Backend

The backend is a **Flask (Python)** application that provides a secure REST API for authentication and persistent data storage. It is designed to work with the React frontend and lives in the `backend/` directory. See [`backend/README.md`](backend/README.md) for full setup instructions.

> **The backend is optional for local development.** The frontend runs fully standalone using `localStorage` for progress persistence. The Flask API is only required if you want server-side user accounts, token verification, or cloud-synced progress via Firestore.

### Key Files

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `app.py` | Application entry point — initialises Firebase Admin SDK, registers routes, and wires up all middleware |
| `bouncer.py` | Input sanitisation layer — strips HTML/XSS payloads, blocks path traversal in filenames, and validates numeric inputs before any data is processed |
| `middleware.py` | Attaches a full suite of HTTP security headers (`Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-Frame-Options`, `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`) to every response |
| `logger.py` | Secure error logger — writes detailed error information to `app.log`, never to the HTTP response, so stack traces and internal state are never leaked to clients |

### API Endpoints

| Method | Route | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/api/status` | Health check — returns `{"status": "online", "secure": true}` |
| `POST` | `/api/login` | Accepts a username, sanitises input via `bouncer.py`, and authenticates the user |
| `POST` | `/api/verify-token` | Validates a Firebase ID token and returns user identity |
| `GET` | `/api/progress/:userId` | Fetches a user's full progress object |
| `PUT` | `/api/progress/:userId` | Persists a user's progress object |
| `POST` | `/api/progress/:userId/notebook` | Creates a new lab notebook entry |
| `DELETE` | `/api/progress/:userId/notebook/:entryId` | Deletes a lab notebook entry |
| `GET` | `/api/curriculum` | Serves the full curriculum JSON |
| `GET` | `/api/dictionary` | Serves the full dictionary JSON |

### Frontend API Client

`src/lib/api.ts` provides typed wrappers around every endpoint. All calls fail silently — if the backend is unavailable, `localStorage` continues to handle persistence automatically.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Technology | Version | Role |
|------------|---------|------|
| **React** | 19.0 | UI framework; hooks for all state management |
| **TypeScript** | 5.8 | Type safety across the entire codebase |
| **Vite** | 6.2 | Dev server, HMR, and production bundler |
| **Tailwind CSS** | 4.1 | Utility-first styling via `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin |
| **Motion** | 12.x | Declarative animations for UI transitions |
| **Lucide React** | 0.546 | Consistent SVG icon library |
| **Express** | 4.x | HTTP API server for backend persistence layer |
| **better-sqlite3** | 12.x | Embedded SQLite database driver |
| **dotenv** | 17.x | Environment variable loading for server config |
| **tsx** | 4.x | TypeScript execution for Node.js server scripts |
| **mkcert** | via `vite-plugin-mkcert` | Auto-generates trusted local HTTPS certificates |
| **localStorage** | Browser native | Client-side progress persistence (current default) |

### Architecture Decisions

- **Client-first, backend-ready.** By default all state lives in the browser via `localStorage` — no server is required to run the app. A full relational database schema (`db-schema.txt`) and backend dependencies (`express`, `better-sqlite3`) are included for teams that want server-side user accounts and persistent progress.
- **Single-page application.** Navigation is tab-based state (`activeTab`) in `App.tsx` — no router library needed.
- **Static data.** The entire curriculum is defined as a typed TypeScript array in `src/data/curriculum.ts`, making it easy to read, edit, and extend.
- **Database schema.** `db-schema.txt` defines a normalized relational schema (PostgreSQL-compatible, adaptable to SQLite) covering users, project progress, badges, lab notebook entries, and the dictionary. It is designed to be a drop-in replacement for the `localStorage` data model.
- **Progressive level locking** is implemented but disabled by default (all levels unlocked). Re-enable it via the `isProjectLocked` function in `App.tsx`.

## 🔍 Feature Deep Dives

### Progress & Badge System

Progress is stored in a `UserProgress` object persisted to `localStorage` under the key `rpi-lab-progress`:

```typescript
interface UserProgress {
  projectStatuses: Record<string, 'Not Started' | 'In Progress' | 'Completed'>;
  badges: string[];
  labNotebook: LabEntry[];
}
```

- A project moves to **In Progress** the moment you click into it.
- A project moves to **Completed** only after you submit a Lab Notebook entry.
- Each completed project awards the `badgeEarned` string defined in `curriculum.ts`.

### Lab Notebook

When you complete a project, a modal prompts you to fill in a structured reflection:

| Field | Prompt |
|-------|--------|
| `whatWorked` | What worked as expected? |
| `whatDidnt` | What didn't work or surprised you? |
| `whatChanged` | What did you change from the original instructions? |
| `oneThingLearned` | The single most important thing you learned |

All entries are saved to `progress.labNotebook` and viewable in the **Lab Notebook** tab.

### GPIO Pinout Reference

The **Pinout** tab provides an interactive reference for all Raspberry Pi GPIO pins — physical pin numbers, BCM numbers, and function labels — without needing to leave the app or search the web.

### Electronics Dictionary

The **Dictionary** tab is a searchable glossary of 100+ terms organized into three categories:

- **Python** — language concepts and gpiozero patterns
- **Raspberry Pi** — board-specific terms (BCM, GPIO, I2C, etc.)
- **Electronics** — hardware fundamentals (resistor, duty cycle, PIR, etc.)

**Interactive Term Highlighting:** Throughout project content, technical terms from the dictionary are automatically highlighted. Click any highlighted term to see its definition in a popup — no need to leave the page or open a new tab.

---

## 🎨 Customization

### Adding a New Project

Add an entry to the `curriculum` array in `src/data/curriculum.ts`:

```typescript
{
  id: 'p8-servo',
  level: 8,
  levelName: 'Servo & Motor Control',
  title: 'Servo Motor',
  skillsLearned: ['AngularServo', 'PWM', 'Mechanical output'],
  badgeEarned: 'Motor Maven',
  content: {
    overview: {
      description: 'Control a servo motor with precise angle positioning.',
      concepts: ['AngularServo', 'PWM', 'Signal timing'],
      difficulty: 3,
      estimatedTime: '30 mins'
    },
    hardwareSetup: {
      warnings: ['Do not stall the servo against a hard stop — it will overheat.'],
      steps: ['Connect servo signal wire to GPIO 17', '...'],
      explanation: '...'
    },
    code: `from gpiozero import AngularServo\n...`,
    codeWalkthrough: [
      { section: 'AngularServo', explanation: '...' }
    ],
    conceptDeepDive: {
      hardware: '...',
      software: '...',
      connection: '...'
    },
    experimentMode: {
      tweak: 'Change the min_angle and max_angle values.',
      logic: 'Write a loop that sweeps the servo back and forth.',
      creative: 'Build a simple robotic arm or door latch.'
    },
    troubleshooting: [
      { issue: 'Servo jitters', solution: 'Use hardware PWM pin (GPIO 12 or 18).' }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Adding Dictionary Entries

Add entries to the array in `src/data/dictionary.ts`:

```typescript
{
  term: 'AngularServo',
  category: 'Raspberry Pi',
  definition: 'A gpiozero class for controlling servo motors by angle.',
  example: 'servo = AngularServo(17, min_angle=-90, max_angle=90)'
}
```

### Enabling Level Locking

By default `isProjectLocked()` in `App.tsx` always returns `false` (all levels unlocked). To require completing all projects in a level before unlocking the next, uncomment the logic block in that function:

```typescript
const isProjectLocked = (projectId: string) => {
  const project = curriculum.find(p => p.id === projectId);
  if (!project || project.level === 1) return false;
  const previousLevelProjects = curriculum.filter(p => p.level === project.level - 1);
  return !previousLevelProjects.every(p => progress.projectStatuses[p.id] === 'Completed');
};
```

### Disabling HTTPS in Development

If you prefer HTTP in development, remove the `mkcert()` plugin from `vite.config.ts`:

```typescript
// plugins: [react(), tailwindcss(), mkcert()],  // with HTTPS
plugins: [react(), tailwindcss()],               // without HTTPS
```
